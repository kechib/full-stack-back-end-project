# full-stack-back-end-project
This is my first full stack single page application. Creating the back-end was an interesting expirence. This is the API for my makeup reviews application.

  I learned that the back end part of the application is the tools, while the front end is the frame and picture. I struggled with understanding the elements of mongoose methods. I did understand more about promise chains, which I struggled with before this point. Actually making these elements myself helped me learn these concepts a little more. I hope to build on the application making more complex models and routes in the future.
